# Meal Tracking System

This software was created during my Software Specifications course. This software shall be developed so that to-go specialists and culinary staff donâ€™t have to spend as much time reviewing orders and potentially forgetting items. Using this system will provide more satisfaction to customers since it will be less likely for them to have the wrong order/item.

## Prototype

### Business Requirements Specification (BRS)
My BRS was created with a different stakeholder at a different company, so some of the information may not match with the SRS

## Technology
Throughout this course, I utilized [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) for requirements management and issue tracking, as well as note taking and elicitation with my stakeholders. I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to demonstrate my prototypes to my stakeholders
